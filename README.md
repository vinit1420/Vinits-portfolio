# [Project 1: HDFC: Business Analyst - RBI Card Performance Dashboard](https://github.com/vinit1420/HDFC-Performance-Dashboard/tree/main)

This project is a part of the Micro-experience program that I completed with bluetick.ai. They have come up with this industry use case in partnership with HDFC Bank to simulate the kind of work a business analyst would be doing at HDFC. The aim of this project was to help the management at HDFC Bank by creating a dashboard to compare their performance in the debit and credit cards segment with the rest of the industry in-turn playing a key role in strategic planning and decision making.
